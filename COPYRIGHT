README.License.Change

---

June 15, 2024

N11 Software has updated the N11 Public Source License to version 2.0,
effective immediately. These changes apply to all versions of
software distributed under this license, as well as the N11/Inferno
Software Distribution ("NISD").

This update clarifies certain terms, aligns more closly to open-source
practices, and incorporates feedback from various users.

Specifically, the following has been changed:
	1. Definitions
	   - Added a definition for "N11" to clarify it refers to
	     "N11 Software and its contributors".
	   - Fixed wording for "Object Code" to specify it is "run by
	     the user" instead of "ran by the user".
	2. Permitted Uses
	   - Fix wording to explicitly grant the rights to use, modify,
	     and distribute the Source Code or Object Code.
	3. Redistribution Use
	   - Introduced a new section specifically addressing the
	     distribution of Object Code for commercial or
	     non-commercial purposes.

The NISD license file (Documentation/UserGuide/COPYRIGHT) now reflects
these changes. If you have not obtained a copy of the License, see the
health-files.git repository in n11.dev.
